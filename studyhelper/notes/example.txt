Rayleigh scattering, named after the 19th-century British physicist Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt), 
is the predominantly elastic scattering of light or 
other electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. 
For light frequencies well below the resonance frequency of the scattering medium (normal dispersion regime),
the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength,
e.g., a blue color is scattered much more than a red color as light propagates through air.
